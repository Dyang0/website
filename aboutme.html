    <div class="myDiv">
        <p>I am currently a sophomore at Virginia Tech enrolled as a Computer Science major. 
            I wanted to be an engineer because I love analyzing issues and solving problems 
            whether that be through spending hours debugging a program or discovering new 
            fields/skills. My goals are to learn more about my field by starting side projects 
            and applying for internships. I was always fascinated by the gaming industry and the 
            production that ranges from the beautiful art/game design to meticulous software development. 
            The idea that different programming languages can reflect real world applications amazes me to this day.</p>
